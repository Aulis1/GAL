## Things still in development
I am still working on a better retaining method for the laser zeroing, so any suggestions are appreciated!

Once the design is hammered out, I plan on making a PCB for the switching circuit and good wire routing.

Also there are a few lasers I plan on testing with. Both are 980nm lasers, one is supposedly [30mW](https://www.aliexpress.us/item/2261799874302117.html) and the other is supposedly [~~5mW~~](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08D9QQPP3) (I received a very powerful green beam laser and it's also not available anymore). Lots of testing on this front is needed. If you have any suggestions for lasers in this band, it would be appreciated as well.
